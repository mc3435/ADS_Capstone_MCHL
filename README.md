## Abstract
This study investigates the ability to use previous medical records to identify genetic disorder risk in patients. Genodetect, a machine learning solution tailored to meet this objective, is presented with the motivation to address the imperative need for early detection and intervention in genetic disorders, with a focus on real-life integration for practical healthcare applications. GenoDetectâ€™s key objective is to build an adaptable model capable of precisely identifying increased risk for genetic disorders, catering to diverse, or even incomplete, medical records. The study employs the Genomes and Genetics dataset, extracted from Kaggle, and employs Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) as the successful modeling technique. Despite limitations including dataset quality and imbalance of provided outcomes, results show the efficacy of XGBoost and other models in predicting genetic disorder risks based on medical history, particularly excelling in identifying true positives. However, the study acknowledges the complexity of the genetic landscape and recognizes potential limitations in generalizability to diverse populations. This research offers a comprehensive foundation for advancing genetic disorder prediction, showcasing the practical utility of GeneDetect. The implications of this study lie in the tangible applications of machine learning in healthcare diagnostics, emphasizing the importance of early identification for improved patient outcomes.
